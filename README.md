# Printing for Less Developer Assessment Mini Project WIP

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4. The assignment was to hook into a test API, get and display products, generate order form for products, and submit an order.

I was able to successfully display products and dynamically display the appropriate order form fields for a specific product.

## Firebase Hosted Angular Application

https://pfl-dev-assessment.firebaseapp.com/

To open the application I had to use this command, in order to get around a CORS configuration issue.

```
open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir
```

* This project was build using Angular CLI.
* I referenced the official Angular tutorial: https://angular.io/tutorial


### TODO:
* Add a dashboard with search capability.
* Add more than one item to an order.
* Debug POST call.
* Finish order summary page
* Overall Styling.
